            <li><h1>Marine Houshou</h1></li>
            <li><h3>A member of HOLOLIVE JP.<br></h3>
                <p>Houshou Marine (宝鐘マリン) is a female Japanese Virtual YouTuber associated with hololive,
                debuting as part of its third generation of VTubers under the name of "hololive Fantasy" (ホロライブファンタジー) alongside
                Usada Pekora, Uruha Rushia, Shiranui Flare and Shirogane Noel.</p>
                <p>Marine is a bold, fast-talking girl who often throws caution to the wind, making obscene jokes and playfully mocking both her higher-ups and her viewers.<br>
                Marine describes her way of approaching people is through to talk to them so she may get in their circle,
                as described when talking about the differences between herself and Nakiri Ayame.</p>
                <p>She often struggles to keep her lewdness in check, with her openly lusting after fictional female characters, reading BL and claiming to be a former shotacon (despite still showing some attraction in fiction).<br>
                This has lead her to describe herself as extremely horny, with the phrase "I'm Hornyyyy!~♪" being a fan favorite since her 3D stream with Kiryu Coco.
                At times she even tries charming and seducing her way out of sticky situations, which has backfired on her at times.</p>
                <p>Though she claims to be 17 years old, her self-described "auntie" voice, lack of physical stamina, and extensive knowledge of 2000-2010 Internet culture indicate that she is almost certainly older than she claims she is.<br>
                This is supported by other hololive members' habits of teasing her about her age. Her age has become a recurring joke on her channel; for example, on 30 July 2020 (Marine's birthday),
                she claimed to be turning 17 again for a "second season," to which Himemori Luna states, via a drawing, that she is 27.</p>
                <p>Yet in spite of the antics Marine is popular for, Marine typically shows herself to be cultured with the variety topics she brings up in her streams,<br>
                ranging from popular to niche, and regularly talks about the happenings behind the scenes at hololive on her own accord. She is also extremely sensitive to her surroundings especially when it comes to social environment,
                as she was able to instinctively pick up Usada Pekora's discomfort with others in her space and even spoke up about how she managed to avoid trouble in a previous office job such as avoiding getting yelled at by her ex-boss.
                As such she is marked as having "the highest stats" in social insight out of every idol in hololive by her fans.</p>
                <p>She greets her viewers with "Ahoy!", a typical pirate greeting.</p>
